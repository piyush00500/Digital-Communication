# Digital-Communication
“This project is an interactive digital communication dashboard built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It shows sampling, line coding, modulation, PCM, and delta modulation using real-time waveforms on canvas. Users can change values with sliders, and JS draws signals to make concepts easy to understand.”
